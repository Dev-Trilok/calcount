<h1><pr>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> <i>Salad</b> </i>. Of course, some soups are far healthier than some salads. But, in general, you’re better off with a salad of mixed greens and raw vegetables, coupled with a light, healthy dressing. You’ll get more fiber and thus more filling for your calories, not to mention the healthy dose of disease-fighting antioxidants found in raw vegetables. Many soups are very healthy, but the cooking process can diminish some of the ingredients’ nutritional value.
